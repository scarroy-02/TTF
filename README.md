Tried SVM on 3 classes of graphs with 303 total graphs. Was giving accuracy 1.0 when having 2 completely random graphs as classes.

So, made 2 classes with slight changes.

* PersistenceScaleSpaceKernel : 0.91
* PersistenceFisherKernel : 0.26
* PersistenceWeightedGaussianKernel : 0.91
* SlicedWassersteinKernel : 0.68

Try scaling the kernel matrix.
